## Michael T. Miyoshi

I am not a professional software developer.  I am a high school teacher who teaches computer programming and engineering (CAD).  I do have development repositories, but most of my repositories have to do with the subjects I teach.  So if you are one of my students, you are in the right place.  I have (or will have) links to important information.  I have other notes at the bottom of this page for educators.

### Students

This page might not make sense right away, but it is a resource for students, so I have arranged it in order of what students will most often need (in other words, what they ask me most about).  Here is a list with relative links.

* [Leadership](#leadership)
* [Introduction to Computer Programming](#introduction-to-computer-programming)
* [Game and App Development](#game-and-app-development)
* [AP Computer Science](#ap-computer-science)
* [Architectural and Engineering Design](#architectural-and-engineering-design)
* [More Notes](#more-notes)

By the way, part of the reason I created this page at the top of my repository is because I have so much stuff in different repositories that I needed to clean things up.  I have rubrics and example documents that are out of date.  So instead of just getting rid of the clutter (which I hope to do eventually), I created this readme to help link you to the things you need.

#### Leadership

Leadership is an important part of Career and Technical Education (CTE) classes.  As such, there are certain leadership activities that we do in class.  The three that we do in class are described in the links below.  You can (and should) also go to the [Learning with Miyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi) repo to read about grading and such.



#### Introduction to Computer Programming

#### Game and App Development

#### AP Computer Science

#### Architectural and Engineering Design

#### More Notes

Notes to educators:  If you are an educator, please feel free to use my public repositories as resources and starting points.  (It would be great if you gave me credit or even pointed people in my direction.)  One other note for educators who teach C# in their classrooms.  I have a C# book ([C# with Miyoshi](https://amzn.to/45QCtdA)) available on Amazon.  It is always a work in progress and maybe even more so currently (going into the 2025-2026 school year).  (My C++ book ([C++ with Miyoshi](https://amzn.to/4kdUVQJ)) is not comprehensive by any stretch of the imagination, but it is more refined than my C# book, and I used it for many years with good success.  My students got the fundamentals, which was what I was looking for.)  By the way, if you are one of my students, you do NOT need to purchase my book.  I repeat.  If you are one of my students, you do NOT need to purchase one of my books.  (Everybody else should.)  By the way, at the time of this writing, my C# and C++ books are only available digitally.
