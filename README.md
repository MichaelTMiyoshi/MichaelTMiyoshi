## Michael T. Miyoshi

I am not a professional software developer.  I am a high school teacher who teaches computer programming and engineering (CAD).  I do have development repositories, but most of my repositories have to do with the subjects I teach.  So if you are one of my students, you are in the right place.  I have (or will have) links to important information.  I have other notes at the bottom of this page for educators.

### Students

This page might not make sense right away, but it is a resource for students, so I have arranged it in order of what students will most often need (in other words, what they ask me most about).  Here is a list with relative links.

* [Leadership](#leadership)
* [Introduction to Computer Programming](#introduction-to-computer-programming)
* [Game and App Development](#game-and-app-development)
* [AP Computer Science](#ap-computer-science)
* [Architectural and Engineering Design](#architectural-and-engineering-design)
* [More Notes](#more-notes)

By the way, part of the reason I created this page at the top of my repository is because I have so much stuff in different repositories that I needed to clean things up.  I have rubrics and example documents that are out of date.  So instead of just getting rid of the clutter (which I hope to do eventually), I created this readme to help link you to the things you need.

#### Leadership

Leadership is an important part of Career and Technical Education (CTE) classes.  As such, there are certain leadership activities that we do in class.  The three that we do in class are described in the links below.  You can (and should) also go to the [Learning with Miyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi) repo to read about grading and such.

* [Leadership](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/tree/main/Leadership)  This folder in the LearningWithMiyoshi repo has many of the leadership requirements for activities.  These are given as both files you can download and as pages you can read.
* [Geek Pamphlet](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Leadership/GeekPamphlet-Leadership.md)  You are to develop a 3-fold brochure to tell people about what sort of career you might like to pursue.  The requirements are given on the page.  Also note that if you take my class multiple times, you need to create a new brochure/pamphlet each school year.  Also, note that there is a Word document that you can use for your 3-fold pamphlet.  [Three-fold brochure document](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Leadership/ThreeFoldBrochure.docx)  You will need to download the document to use it.  (By the way, the brochure does not need to be created digitally.  I have had many students recently do a great job creating them manually.
* [Inquiry and Thank You letters](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Leadership/leadership_inq_letter.md)  This is a set of two letters.  You must write and send the inquiry letter.  To maximize your points, you need to send the letter out of state.  You may send it to somebody you know, but not to people in your immediate household (even if they are away).  (You will be more likely to get a response from somebody you know.)  You must write the thank you letter, but you do not need to send it until after somebody responds to you.
* [Resume](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/blob/main/Leadership/Rubric-Resume.md)  The resume activity is two-fold.  You must produce a resume and evaluate it based on the rubric.  Then, you must edit it according to your honest evaluation.  The first resume will give you 0.25 of the grade and the updated (assuming it is actually updated) will give you the rest of the points.
* [Presentation Rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/blob/main/_CommonDocuments/Rubric-Presentation.md)  Everybody is supposed to give at least one evaluated presentation.  This is a link to the rubric for that presentation.  If you go up a level in the repository, you can see a downloadable word document of the rubric.

I give a leadership sheet out to students on the first day.  This sheet is for documentation purposes.  I do not have a digital copy because I want students to be responsible for those sheets.  As part of that responsibility, they need to pay points to get a new sheet.  (I work with the students to help make sure this does not happen very often.)

#### Visual Studio Code

I have used Visual Studio Community for years in my classroom.  When we went to most students using their student laptops, this became cumbersome.  After all, just to code and run C# programs required 8 GB of hard drive space and lots of time to install.  To help alleviate some of that space and time requirement, I decided (with the help of my friend and classroom volunteer, Mike) to bite the bullet and migrate to Visual Studio Code (VS Code).  VS Code installs quickly and it even has a great way to set things up so that all the students have the same setup.  If you are in my classroom, you should be set up already.  If not, you can downloade VS Code, then import the profile.  It is a simple process.  And best of all, it is light and quick.  Oh.  And it is free too.

* [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  Note: There are little buttons next to descriptive words.  If you would like to install VS Code for everybody on your computer, use the system installer (Windows) for your OS.  If you just want to install it for yourself on your own user profile, you can just hit the proper OS button.
* Set up the VS Code [Profile](https://gist.github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/98b5f40cd67b28152b80e2c80684f8dc)

If you are a Game and App Development student, follow the above directions if you are using Unity.

Note that Python is already set up with VS Code.  If you like VS Code as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), then you can add other languages too (like Java).  I have not added Java to the student profile at this point in time.

#### Introduction to Computer Programming

There are several main repositories (or folders/documents within repositories) that intro students need to look be familiar with.  The Williams Game Engine is a repo that the students will not need to look at until they are ready for second semester material.  Note that I do not put limits on how fast students may go.  The slow limits are merely the end of semesters.  Students do need to do enough work (have a preponderance of evidence) to justify their grade.  There is something to note here (and in the C# with Miyoshi repository) that is important.  Students must incorporate code from 2 unique goal sheet problems in each project they turn in to me.  The unique part just means that students cannot just keep incorporating the same goal sheet problems in each project they complete.

* [Programming Projects](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects)  This is the main repository where students refer back to for possible projects to complete.  Some of the projects are much harder than others.
* [C# with Miyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CSharpWithMiyoshi/tree/main)
* [Goal sheet problems](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CSharpWithMiyoshi/tree/main/Problems)  These are great problems to help you develop your skills.
* [Williams Game Engine]()  This is the next to last (penultimate) project you will do.  It is a graphic game using a rendering engine called SFML.
* [Competency Tests](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CSharpWithMiyoshi/tree/main/CompetencyTests)  Note: Competency tests are writing code by hand.  You may redo competency tests for better grades, although you cannot take the same test more than once per day.  And you may not retake a cometency test on the day it is graded and explained to you.

#### Game and App Development

Game and App Development students usually create games and applications using Unity.  Unity works on both MacOS and Windows.  (I believe it also works on Linus, but do not quote me on that.)  Since MacOS does not have a Visual Studio version any more, you will need to use VS Code.  Which is another good reason to use VS Code.  Again, the computers in my room should be set up for this, or will be soon.  If you would like to set things up at home, you may certainly do so.  One thing that all students who use Unity will need to do is create an account with Unity.  You do not need to pay for anything, you just need to sign up.

Students may not want to do the projects listed, but at least the list of projects can give students ideas on what they may want to create.

* [Programming Projects](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects)  This is the main repository where students refer back to for possible projects to complete.  Some of the projects are much harder than others.

Game and App Development students also need to do what is called a competency evaluation.  The link for this document is below.

* [Game and App Development Competency Evaluation Folder](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/tree/main/GameAndAppDev/Documents)

#### AP Computer Science

Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science students will be writing their code using Java.  We have typically used IntelliJ, but students who wish to use VS Code may do so.  As of this writing, I have not tried Java coding on VS Code.

The AP Computer Science students will also be doing projects.  Note that there are several projects that are required.  The Recursion goal sheet and Levenshtein are two projects from second semester.  You may do the projects in any order (including the stuff from second semester during first semester).  Just make sure that we keep track of that in the gradebook somehow.

* [Programming Projects](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/ProgrammingProjects)  This is the main repository where students refer back to for possible projects to complete.  Some of the projects are much harder than others.  (And some are required.)
* [APCS - Java with Miyoshi](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/JavaWithMiyoshi)
* [Goal sheets and other useful stuff](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/JavaWithMiyoshi/tree/master/Problems)

#### Architectural and Engineering Design

The biggest thing for Architectural and Engineering Design students are the rubric and example write-up documents.  The first semester of the Arch & Engr Des I class uses a different writeup.

* [First semester write-up documents folder](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/DesignWithMiyoshi/tree/master/Projects/IntroDesignProject)
* [Advanced Write-up rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/blob/main/_CommonDocuments/Rubric-AdvancedDesignDoc.md)
* [Advanced Write-up folder](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/tree/main/_CommonDocuments)

Advanced students also need to do what is called a competency evaluation.  The link for this document is below.

* [Arch & Engr Des (advanced) Competency Evaluation Folder](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/LearningWithMiyoshi/tree/main/ArchAndEngrDes/Documents)

#### More Notes

Notes to educators:  If you are an educator, please feel free to use my public repositories as resources and starting points.  (It would be great if you gave me credit or even pointed people in my direction.)  One other note for educators who teach C# in their classrooms.  I have a C# book ([C# with Miyoshi](https://amzn.to/45QCtdA)) available on Amazon.  It is always a work in progress and maybe even more so currently (going into the 2025-2026 school year).  (My C++ book ([C++ with Miyoshi](https://amzn.to/4kdUVQJ)) is not comprehensive by any stretch of the imagination, but it is more refined than my C# book, and I used it for many years with good success.  My students got the fundamentals, which was what I was looking for.)  By the way, if you are one of my students, you do NOT need to purchase my book.  I repeat.  If you are one of my students, you do NOT need to purchase one of my books.  (Everybody else should.)  By the way, at the time of this writing, my C# and C++ books are only available digitally.
